# Pumgye (품계)

[한국어](README.ko.md)

Pumgye owns deterministic service roles, permissions, information classes and
user/IP authorization matrices. Hopae owns verified identity and sessions;
Sumunjang supplies network evidence; Hangang enforces the combined decision.

The workspace separates four packages:

- `pumgye-core`: bounded policy compilation and deterministic evaluation. No HTTP, TLS, runtime or database dependencies.
- `pumgye-server`: the independent `pumgye` policy authority, SQLite persistence, transactional audit and HTTP/PPG1 listeners.
- `pumgye-protocol`: bounded PPG1 codec, with borrowed query identifiers and fixed replies.
- `pumgye-client`: authenticated persistent connections, bounded pools/deadlines, batches, correlation and monotonic revision floors.

SQLite is the policy source of truth. Startup recovers and compiles its committed
policy; successful CAS publication atomically commits policy, revision and audit,
then replaces an immutable `ArcSwap` memory snapshot. Decisions never read the DB.
The snapshot remains until the next publication; it is not a 1–5 second decision
result cache. Results currently have zero cache TTL. HTTP cancellation does not
interrupt an admitted durable publication. Persistence uncertainty fences decisions
until restart/recovery. One runtime owns each database; edit policies through its
API rather than changing SQLite directly.

Rights use permission/class bitsets and Sumunjang's compressed prefix trie.
User and network rights must both permit a request. Unassigned subjects are guests,
network deny dominates and required enforcement rejects observe/unavailable evidence.
Callers must supply authenticated identity, trusted source IP and verified evidence;
wire enums do not themselves verify those facts.

Remote listeners require mTLS with an explicitly provisioned client CA, plus separate
admin/decision credentials. Plaintext is limited to loopback. The native client pins
an endpoint, server name and CA and presents its client certificate. See
[server and protocol contracts](docs/SERVER.md).

```sh
cargo test --locked --workspace
cargo clippy --locked --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo build --locked --release --workspace
cargo build --locked --release -p pumgye-client --example qualify
python3 tools/server_smoke.py --binary target/release/pumgye --client target/release/examples/qualify
```

The owned process fixture covers mTLS rejection, role-separated credentials,
HTTP/native parity, persistent pipelining, revision floors, CAS races, publication
revocation, audit, DB ownership and restart recovery. To measure the synthetic native
transport, append `--benchmark 1000000`; this is not full Hangang/Hopae/Sumunjang HTTP
throughput or replica qualification.

The earlier embedded gateway/matrix implementation is qualified in
[Hangang #5](https://github.com/ziozzang/hangang/pull/5). Independent Hangang client
and delegated administration integration, replica leases/revocation, and mixed
human/machine authentication remain implementation gates. The presence of these
packages does not establish completion of the full zero-trust stack.

Qualify the earlier owned gateway baseline with
`python3 tools/hangang_smoke.py --gateway-binary /path/to/hangang`.
